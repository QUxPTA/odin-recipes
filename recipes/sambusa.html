      </li>
      <li>Add salt and chilli to the meat after about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Continue stirring and crushing the meat to prevent it from forming
        balls.
      </li>
      <li>Cook the meat until it dries.</li>
      <li>Add the leek, garlic and coriander after 4 minutes and stir.</li>

    <h3>Breading (Samosa Pocket Preparation):</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put 2 ½ cups flour in a bowl and add 1 cup cold water. Mix into a medium
        soft dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough onto a flat surface and knead thor- oughly until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a thick long roll, cut into 9 pieces and make the pieces into small
        balls.
      </li>
      <li>Roll out the balls, one at a time into desired thickness.</li>
      <li>
        Flour the surface, slightly oil the top of each rolled-out ball and
        stack them on top of each other. Continue until all the pieces are
        placed.
      </li>
      <li>Stitch the edges by poking light holes.</li>
      <li>Roll them out together to one large round piece.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a shallow pan and toast the rolled dough for 2 minutes per side. If
        the shallow pan is too small, cut the rolled-out dough to fit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast each side lightly, peeling off each layer after toasting until all
        the 9 pieces are separated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut triangular shapes on each separated piece; fold each of the
        triangular pieces into an enve- lope and seal the edges with a
        preparation of wheat flour paste.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembly (Making paste):</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The paste is used to seal the envelopes.</li>
      <li>Mix ¼ cup of water and ½ cup of flour to make a thick paste.</li>
      <li>Make the casings using the paste to bond and seal the edges.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling the Samosa:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Spoon the cooled meat filling into the casings and seal off the edges
        using the paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not overfill the casings to prevent it any tears or rips on them.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the remaining oil in a deep pan up to 170°C or about 6 minutes or
        until the oil bubbles when a pinch of dough is dropped in the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully, deep each samosa into the hot oil and cook while turning
        until golden brown on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the hot oil making sure to let any excess oil drain back
        into the pan.
      </li>
      <li>Place onto paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>
      <li>Repeat the process until all the samosas are cooked.</li>
      <li>Serve.</li>
