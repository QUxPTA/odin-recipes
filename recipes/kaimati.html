    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Kaimatis get their unique flavour from the style with which yeast is
      applied on wheat flour. This traditional breakfast dish or day snack is
      common among the Swahili and Bajuni communities and was inherited from
      Arab culture. It serves the whole family.
